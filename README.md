# Chord Cleaner
### I need a better name for this

Based on inputted Notes, this program analyzes them to identify the chord. This program does NOT support
slash notation, and assumes that the lowest provided note is the bass. Still in progress.

## Run Instructions
Run ChordCleaner.java to get the user interface. In the interface, you must provide each given note in the format:
> (note)(accidental, or blank for natural)(octave)

For example:
> Bb7
> C#4
> A3
> Abb1
> Ax3
